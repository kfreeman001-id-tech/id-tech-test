(1) This query returns the number of stories whose user_id is 1.

(2) This query returns both tag_id and count in descending order (based on count) of lobster stories whose hotness is greater than 0 aggregated by taggings' story_id being equal to stories' id.

(3) This query returns stories' id, title, upvotes, and downvotes of stories whose created_at values are greater than '2017-01-23 00:00:00', hiddens' user_id is NOT 1, and hiddens' story id is equal to stories' id.

(4) This query returns stories' id and title whose taggings' story_id are NOT 2,6, or 7 and whose hiddens' user_id are NOT 3, 4, or 5 and whose stories' hotness is greater than 0 and whose stories' created_at is greater than '2017-01-23 00:00:00'.

Query (4) is well-suited for a column store because it computes aggregates across many individual tables. Queries (2) and (3) only compute across 2 indivual tables, but (3) returns many rows so it would also be well-suited for a column-store.

Queries A and B return completely different results. After comparing upvotes, downvotes, and hotness between both queries, it seems that hotness is NOT correlated to number of upvotes and number of downvotes.

It seems that query times are much more consistent with the fewer amount of attributes being pulled.
